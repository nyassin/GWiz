GWiz is an autocomplete feature for your Gmail compose page. It allows you to write email faster and smarter.

What can you do with this extension:

1 - Autocomplete phrases that you type very often and create your own.

2- Make variables and store strings within. @signature = your email signature.

3- Directly search WolframAlpha from your Compose page by placing the query within "@" signs. 
@how old is bararck obama?@ will replace this string with "52 years". You can also use it as a calculator @3*4@ will replace it with "12". Another example is @facebook stock price@ will return $38.
